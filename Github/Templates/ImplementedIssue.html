<h3>Implementation Steps</h3>
1. Create a branch from `development-<?= pack.short ?>` (you may use a single branch for multiple implementations/updates)
2. Create & implement new card file for this card (within 'server/game/cards/<?= pack.short ?>'). Existing cards can be used as templates
3. (Important) Set the card version (near bottom of card) to `ImplementedCardClass.version = '<?= newCard.development.version ?>'`
4. (Optional) Test the implementation locally
5. When ready (single or in bulk), create Pull Request into `development-<?= pack.short ?>` branch, linking this issue in the description as 'Closes: #[this issue number]'
